put here something like:
every hour or so:

1. run the scraper
2. parse data using pandas
3. create csv "suitable for visualisation"
4. replace old csv with the new csv
5. there must be some database with "saved shit - shit i want to buy"
6.  -- so we need some push notification / mailing server also
